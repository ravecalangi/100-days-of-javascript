# 100 Days of JavaScript

This repo is my personal challenge to code in JavaScript every day for 100 days.  
I made this for fun and to build the habit of coding daily.  

Each folder contains one project for the day. Nothing fancy, just practice and consistency.

## Progress
- ✅ Day 1 – Egg Boil Timer

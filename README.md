# 100 Days of JavaScript

This repo is my personal project to code in JavaScript every day for 100 days.  
I made this for fun, to build the habit of coding daily, and to keep learning by doing.  

Each folder has one project, mostly small problems I encounter in a day and think of ways to solve on my own.

## Progress
- ✅ Day 1 – Egg Boil Timer
